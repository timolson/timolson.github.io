Born with a silicon spoon in my mouth, I'm blessed to have learned programming as a child, circa 1980, in the golden era of the home computer. I was a sweet, sheltered Midwestern boy until 14 years in NYC gave me bruises, balls, and ambition, and now I live in the geek Mecca of San Francisco. I enjoy playing sports (especially soccer), board games (Go, Backgammon), and nature (I camp like it's 1499). I also meditate and believe in a personal God.
