excerpt: A good time for all
---

lisp  
to the merry tune  
gather your songs  
sounds  
summon an ale  
and loosen your shirt  
there leans a woman with white laughter  
there stands a man of proud eyes  
here comes our cousin  
bright and free  
have a dance and a story  
music for all  
warm food and thick souls  
friends and dreams  
memories for tomorrow  
the salt of today
