excerpt: When you're romantic with a meditator, it's not just lusty.
---

the brushes of entanglement  
the fire of desire  
nothing remains but  
heat and wind  

casting the lace veil of hair from your face  
strumming each eyebrow as it flows along  
plunging through your eyes  
the mists of agitation billow then clear  
no cataracts of distraction  
to conceal your seeking  
just twinkles of transparency
