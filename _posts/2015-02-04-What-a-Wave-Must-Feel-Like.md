excerpt: The life of a wave
---

flatness at first, just a slope on a swell, a  
grand swell, a leader, aged arms abroad,  
carrys her people to shores of remembrance  
then a bend in her smoothness, not a crease or a pimple,   
just a bunching of skin as the great lady guides us,  
upward it seems, or forward at least,  
a direction of hope which carries our being  
and others i see, ripples and dips,  
lightly here and quickly there,  
learning the tempo of time  
some dance together, while others collide  
in hand with my friends we stride in a row,  
surf down this mountain with freedom like wind  
gaining momentum, and passion, and power  
as untimid turbulence bubbles our crest,  
a crown of white foam to mark our ascent  
wider and broader our thickness prevails  
til stretched in the middle, concavity spent  
we maintain our height, but increasingly slender  
when suddenly smashed is our flank on the left  
obliterated blood drops spray to the sky  
carelessly cleaved by an ignorant rock  
briny gore splatters my sister's remains  
we all feel the beach encroaching beneath us  
sweeping our legs and sucking us down  
the right flank so thin, with arched scoliosis  
its own weight the hammer, a brittle collapse  
now face-down in shame, our hubris expended  
grovelling grit peels the skin from my lip  
a transparent, silent exhale ashore
