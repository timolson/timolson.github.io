excerpt: Whether running from anguish or chasing delight, there's no satisfaction in agitation.
---

in times of danger, trouble and fire  
the slap of heat, your swollen hair  
each pore is a pin&mdash;

you can grind down your nails by  
scratching for blood  
but the red oil burns no sin  

the sticky hopes you chase all day  
cannot be swallowed without a sting  
there's glass in that honey  

so roll up your tongue and  
chew it down  
stop wanting love and money
